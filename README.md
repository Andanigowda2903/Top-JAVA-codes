## About

In this repository, you'll find various Java programs demonstrating different concepts and techniques. Each program is a step towards mastering Java and improving my coding skills. The codes cover topics like:

- Basic syntax
- Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Data structures (arrays, lists)
- Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Special topics (Armstrong numbers, Fibonacci series, etc.)

## Installation

To run the codes in this repository, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
